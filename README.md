## Overview
One of my freelance clients kindly let me publicly share their custom site I developed and designed. This site was created using React to help lower development time, it's a single page info page with integrated contact form. The purpose of this website is to

1. Display information about the business.
2. Lead users to the contact form.

The client was previously using a CMS based site and was looking for a more custom page to suit their brand. As they get most of their traffic from a third party organisation site, the main focus for this website is to make the business seem friendly and approachable and lead users to get in touch.
